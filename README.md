# Java-Raycaster_v1

This is the Java ☕ implementation of a simple raycaster engine. I was very interested in understanding the working of psuedo 3d games like DOOM and youtuber 3DSage's video (who implemented this using C and OpenGL) inspired me even more to try and implement it myself.

The raycaster can be run directly from the executable jar file. Use either Arrow keys or WASD keys to move the player.
