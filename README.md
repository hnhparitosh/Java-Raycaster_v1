# Java-Raycaster_v1

This is the Java ☕ implementation of the raycaster engine (implemented in C using OpenGL) made by the youtuber 3DSage. I was alreaady interested in the Raycasting Engine and 3DSage's video inspired me even more to try and implement it myself.

The raycaster can be run directly from the executable jar file. Use either Arrow keys or WASD keys to move the player.
